title: Break Time to Concentrate
---

So I'm pulling back from my daily blog unless I have code to write about. I can concentrate on school and extra 30 mins to an hour per day if I don't write. Here's something interesting I'm pondering and haven't tested yet. I'm not really sure why I haven't tested it but...

```javascript
// To ensure JS is loaded after the page loads
$(document).ready(function () {

})

// Better way to do the same
$(function () {

})

// Does this work?
$(() => {

})
```
