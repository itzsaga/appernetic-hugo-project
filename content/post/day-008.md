Started the day off with a win before 8 am. I was working on a lab to take an array and return a string with Oxford commas inserted. I finished the lab and had it passing tests then refactored and chopped two lines of code out of it. This made me happy.  
Original code:
```ruby
def oxford_comma(array)
  if array.length == 1
    return "#{array[0]}"
  elsif array.length == 2
    return array.join(" and ")
  elsif array.length >= 3
    new_last_array_item = "and #{array[-1]}"
    array.pop
    array.push(new_last_array_item)
    return array.join(", ")
  end
end
```
Refactored code:
```ruby
def oxford_comma(array)
  if array.length == 1
    return "#{array[0]}"
  elsif array.length == 2
    return array.join(" and ")
  elsif array.length >= 3
    array[-1] = "and #{array[-1]}"
    return array.join(", ")
  end
end
```
Another refactoring win today while the kids were napping. I had the following to accomplish: "Write a method called `reverse_each_word` that takes in a string argument of a sentence and returns that same sentence with each word reversed in place."
```ruby
# FIRST METHOD THAT PASSED
def reverse_each_word(array)
  new_array = array.split(" ")
  reversed_array = new_array.each {|x| x.reverse!}
  return reversed_array.join(" ")
end

# FIRST REFACTORED CODE
def reverse_each_word(array)
  new_array = array.split(" ")
  new_array.collect {|x| x.reverse!}
  new_array.join(" ")
end

# FINAL SOLUTION
def reverse_each_word(array)
  array.split(" ").collect {|x| x.reverse!}.join(" ")
end
```
I realized that I could chain the mehods together since I was calling them all on the same element. Then I also realized that it was going to return automatically from the method so I had no need for the return either. [Ruby-Doc][1] is quickly becoming one of my best friends while working on this Procedural Ruby section.

Today was the day of Slack distraction. This can be seen by the number of lessons I completed. However, networking and connecting with other students is important to an extent as well. A few other students and I started down the rabbit hole of health and wellness and biohacking etc... I was able to share some of the things I do like my morning stretching from [Gymnastic Bodies][2], how I drink my coffee cocktail (coffee + grassfed ghee currently), and meditation utilizing [Calm][3]. Also how I diffuse essential oils in the office I study/code in and listen to [Brain.fm][4] while I code. How I have some [Four Sigmatic Lion's Mane Elixir][5] on the way from [Thrive Market][6] (because it's <$26 there) and some [Brain Boost][7] from Amazon.
