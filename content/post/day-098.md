title: The Asset Pipeline Is Flowing
---

I finally got back into the swing of Flatiron. I did <30 mins of school yesterday so I just chose to blog about FCC. A lot of reading going on as of late. The [Rails asset pipeline][1] and how to use it. I actually figured out some of this since I implemented Bootstrap in my Rails Portfolio Project. It felt good to plow through some labs tonight. I'm so close. Now is the time to crank up the intensity and really go at it to the finish line.

I have to say, I don't know much about other back ends but the asset pipeline is a pretty neat feature of Rails. I guess being such a mature framework has it's benefits.
