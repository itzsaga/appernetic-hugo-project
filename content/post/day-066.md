title: Render Partial New Mouse, What?
---

Cut it short tonight. Needed to. Learned some more about rendering partials tonight. Main takeaway code example `<%= render partial: 'songs/song_details', collection: @genre.songs, as: :song %>` will iterate through `@genre.songs` and passes those objects to the partial as `song`.

My wife bought be a trackball mouse :-)
