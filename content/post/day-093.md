title: Mocha, Chai, or Just Some Jasmine?
---

I just spent way too much time looking into [Mocha][1], [Chai][2], [Jasmine][3], and I can't remember what other test libraries. Trying to solve this [testing problem][4] we have over in [Javscripting][5] that I help maintain. I like the fact that there's this problem that needs to be solved and it's something I can learn from. Now I'm trying to figure out how to test against a file that has no functions in it. I think this is simpler than I'm making it out to be. I need to just create a simple testing environment and start playing around. I think that's what I'll do.

I'm 5 lessons/labs away from finishing Advanced JavaScript and moving into Rails and JavaScript. I'm officially 77% of the way there! Now bedtime as it's late enough as it is.

Time spent today: 2:22  
Time spent total: 355:27
