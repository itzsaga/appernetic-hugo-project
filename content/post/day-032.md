Almost 3 hours of review vidoes watched tonight. On thing that I think can be very useful to all. A double bang `!!` converts an object to it's truthy value. For example:

```shell
seth@seth-u:~$ irb
2.4.0 :001 > 1
 => 1
2.4.0 :002 > !1
 => false
2.4.0 :003 > !!1
 => true
```

So the return value of `1` is `1` we know `1` has a boolean value of `true`. So `!1` is `false` and thus `!!1` is `true`. This can be useful for obvious reasons.
