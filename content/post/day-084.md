I tidied up my app today. I decided to scrub the DB and run a new set of seeds then test everything as best I could. This is where I see automated testing is **very** useful. I really want to get better acquainted with writing tests. However, I also want to finish this curriculum so I can stop paying tuition. I'm slowly building out my testing resources to take a deeper dive into that once I'm done with Flatiron. I think having high code coverage for my projects will make them more impressive to employers. I know TDD is a key thing being done these days so demonstrating I understand how to do it will be a nice touch.

So I just spent about an hour integrating [Travis CI][1] and [Coveralls][2] into my app. I'm not really sure how Coveralls decides the coverage but apparently I have 90% coverage with only 4 tests lol. I bet I can get that up higher. I **DO** want to finish writing tests for my models at least. I don't think I'll delve into Capybara testing at all for this. I think some comprehensive model tests will be a good start. I asked in NashDev #javascript about JS testing tools and a lot of people mentioned [Jest][3] although it doesn't do browser testing. [Cypress.io][4] was mentioned favorably as well although it appears to be in closed beta. This looked really interesting to me. Also for browser testing [Selenium][5] and [TestCafe][6] were thrown into the conversation. TestCafe looks cool but It's also $500 so it better be good haha. I applied to get early access to Cypress so we'll see how that goes.

Take a look at my app [here][7] and leave a comment with bugs, comments or suggestions please.
