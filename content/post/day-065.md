title: Partials of Collections? They're Awesome.
---

Partials are coming together more and I have to say they're pretty sweet. Rails does some automagical stuff that I can't completely wrap my head around just yet. However, I probably won't be able to for a while as the people who created it are **WAY** smarter than me. However, as an example there's this sequence of things that Rails does:

```html
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <%= render :partial => "post", {:locals => {:post => post}} %>
<% end %>

<!-- OR -->

<%= render :partial => "post", :collection => @posts %>

<!-- OR -->

<%= render @posts %>

<!-- Rendering an empty Collection -->

<%= render(@posts) || "There are no blog posts!" %>
```

The craziest part to me is this little bit that I was taught about `<%= render @posts %>` which I have bolded for emphasis:

> This approach is a bit more abstract. Under the hood Rails uses the convention that you will have a partial with the name of the models in the collection. **Rails will even render a collection of heterogeneous models ([customer, order, customer]) calling the correct partial for each one.**

\*Mind Blown\*

I also took part in a virtual stand up yesterday morning. The instructor who led it asked me if I felt I was retaining the information with the pace I've been going (~5 lessons/labs/lectures per day). At the time I said yes because I felt my short days balanced my long days. However, as I worked through some stuff tonight I think my notes are really helping. Pages like this:

![notebook page](../../images/IMG_20170502_221624.jpg)

are awesome for me to cement more abstract things as well as provide a quick reference to go back and look at when I need. As I work through the curriculum I'm going to see which notes are truly valuable and get them migrated over to my Code & Quill book for long term reference.

I <3 the community at Flatiron. Here's a recent chat thread:

> you certainly shouldn't commit them to version control.  looking at the documentation in that Readme from the repo, it has a section on production in which it recommends the `heroku config` methods

> In your Heroku dashboard go to settings and click on Reveal Config Vars.  Those keys and values should reflect your .env file.

> [jilustrisimo][1]  [13 hours ago]
> @[snsavage][5] thanks, I think thats what the doc @[zac-baston][3] linked was pointing me towards…so theoretically just set them there then do whatever I need to do for the callbacks?
>
> [snsavage][5] [13 hours ago]
> So if you’re using something like dotenv you just need to set the values in the dashboard.  Just keep the keys the same as your dotenv file.
