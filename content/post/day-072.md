title: Devise Is A Beast
---

Today I started my Devise learning. I was feeling pretty good until I realized the teaching had stopped and I still had 10 failing tests with no way to solve them. I figured out how to pass one of the tests. I even had it passing. However, I decided to rollback my code as I had literally just been copying and pasting stuff in and I'm sure my code was all over the place. I do have two solid resources which will hopefully provide a good amount of info (outside of the [Devise ReadME][1]). The first is a [Go Rails][2] video suggested by another student and the other is a [Launch School][3] walk through that the curriculum points to. I hope between these three resources I don't have to do too much searching to find any answers I need.

Now that I also know there are a bunch of tests I'll work my way through the tests rather than have a bunch of random ones passing. This should help me with my work flow. I was thrown off tonight when I realized that I needed to get into learn it myself mode. I'll be better prepared mentally tomorrow night.
