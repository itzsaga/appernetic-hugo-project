title: Day 15

Day 15 and I'm still here. If you didn't see it I wrote a [rather long blog post][1] today as one of my requirements for Flatiron. Since that took up over an hour and I had a 1:10.00+ video as a lesson I didn't get much done. However, I **DO** have notes from the past couple of days that I never took the time to share.

So on Saturday morning I did a study group with some people and learned a lot. We went through one of the more challenging Procedural Ruby labs. One thing that I had never though to do was put my `pry` in the `rspec` test file. So I could look at what was going on when everything had already been passed in. I had been putting the `pry` in my code and then needing to call the methods above it before I could work on the current problem. I'm still not 100% on utilizing `pry` but I'm getting there. It's definitely easier and more useful than IRB.

Another nifty thing I learned from the study group, which I'm still not completely comfortable with but makes sense, is calling methods on `end`. For example we did this:
```ruby
def all_holidays_with_bbq(holiday_hash)
  holiday_hash.map do |season, holidays|
    holidays.map do |holiday_name, supplies
      supplies.include?("BBQ") ? holiday_name : nil
    end
  end.flatten.compact
end
```
The way this works is the `.flatten.compact` is being called on the return value of `holiday_hash.map`. It's still settling in my mind and I haven't used it since but I can see where this is useful.

Mike who I pair programmed with last night informed me to get a solid understanding of `self` so I've been taking details notes on things I think are of value. I have:

> We can define methods in which we tell objects to operate on themselves. We do so using the `self` keyword, inside the body of an instance method, to refer to the very same object the method is being called on.

I like that definition and it's not too abstract for me to understand what it's saying.

Lastly, in one of the lectures Avi stated to try not to use the `return` method. He said if you have to use `return` you're probably doing something wrong and utilizing `return` can cause problems. This is because every method has a return. We should be able to get what we need utilizing higher level methods that will return to us what we're looking for. This makes a lot of sense to me. If I have to use the `return` method then I'm probably missing something in the code I'm returning. While this isn't a hard and fast rule it's something I'm going to try and stick to.

If you're keeping up, I didn't look into `||=` `&.` or `.tap` today.

I'm 55% through Object Oriented Ruby. I just realized this because I took a glance at my Dashboard which I haven't really been doing lately. It's moving along but I know it'll take a while once I get to the end. I have some projects to look forward to!
