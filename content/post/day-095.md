This morning came _way_ too soon after last night. However, today was good. Got to see [Jest][1] in action. Saw a simple [Hapi.js][2] server. Learned about [Wallaby.js][3]. Got to do some planning for our table tomorrow and Saturday. Got 3 lessons/labs done in Flatiron and finished the Advanced JS section. It was good. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. However, I will not get sidetracked like I did last night and actually get to bet before 11pm tonight.

If you're keeping track of my lessons total they're going to start to jump as I do the career services stuff in addition to my curriculum.

Time spent today: 3:35  
Time spent total: 362:35  
Lessons completed today: 11  
Lessons completed total: 592
