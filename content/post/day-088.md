title: The DOM & Oh My Zsh!
---

The DOM. Forgot to throw in the main info about the DOM I learned yesterday in last night's blog:

> - The Document Object Model is a representation of the _current view_ of the browser, and can be manipulated without reloading a page.
> - The HTML is the text in a file first used to display the page.
>
> With Javascript we can (1) view a current representation of our Document Object Model. With Javascript we can also (2) select specific portions of the DOM, and manipulate them, which changes what shows up in a browser window.

This small portion of text cleared up what the DOM is after a long time of not truly knowing.

I didn't get as much done tonight as I had wanted. I started late and didn't stay focused so it's all my fault. I spent too much time messing with how my terminal/editor looks. I decided on using [zsh][1] with [Oh My Zsh][2] and a [Powerlevel9k][3] theme. It's pretty sweet. All sourced from [this][4] post I saw on Reddit. Now that I have a solid config at some point I'm sure I'll mess with it more to make it more custom to me. However, I've already done a few minor things like change the ArchLinux logo and text to Ubuntu. It's pretty cool though. I can see what branch I'm working on, if there are uncommitted files, if there are committed files waiting to be pushed, the time, the battery left on my laptop. I can extend these features more too, which I'm sure I'll do someday.
 
 I also spent a bunch of time implementing "proper" linting for JavaScript. There are **so** many style guides out there I struggled figuring out what to setup and use. I ended up deciding on an [ESLint][5] implementation using [JavaScript Standard Style][6]. Turns out WebStorm [supports Standard by default][7] these days so it was easy to setup. However, I had to get it installed which was easy. The hard part was finding where the `node_modules` folder for global installs was on my computer. I ended up running across it as a comment on a Stack Overflow post.
 
 I also got my invite to [Cypress][8] today. I have it installed but haven't done any work with it yet. I think I'll use it to setup tests for my Rails Portfolio Project. Check it out. It's definitely slick. I also started reading [You Don't Know JS][9] as I've been looking for something to do outside of my computer screen to continue my knowledge expansion. Knowing that I'll encounter JavaScript no matter what language I end up working in makes me feel like diving deeper into my knowledge of it will help no matter what. I really do enjoy Ruby but I might end up not working in it so yeah.
