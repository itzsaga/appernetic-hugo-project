title: Coding While Sleeping. Is That Possible?
---

I'm going to be very happy to code during the day tomorrow. I've been tired these last few nights during my target of 8pm - 11pm coding time. I just took a second, leaned back in my chair so my head could rest on the chair back, closed my eyes to think about a problem, and almost fell asleep.

Learned about some [Active Record Callbacks][1] of which there are many more than I would have imagined:

> 1. **Creating an Object**
>   - before_validation
>   - after_validation
>   - before_save
>   - around_save
>   - before_create
>   - around_create
>   - after_create
>   - after_save
>   - after_commit/after_rollback
> 2. **Updating an Object**
>   - before_validation
>   - after_validation
>   - before_save
>   - around_save
>   - before_update
>   - around_update
>   - after_update
>   - after_save
>   - after_commit/after_rollback
> 3. **Destroying an Object**
>   - before_destroy
>   - around_destroy
>   - after_destroy
>   - after_commit/after_rollback

That's all. Goodnight.
