title: Popular Gems Are All The Rage
---

Not much to report today. I spent my time working through some labs that were about popular Ruby Gems and how to find good ones. [Paperclip][1], [Kaminari][2], and [Active Admin][3] were presented and gone over. I also found out that RubyMine is going to be my IDE basically for the rest of the curriculum. This is because I'm writing Rails back end and JS front end. WebStorm is a 100% JS IDE so it would have serious problems with the Rails part of the apps I'll be building. When I implement Node later on I should use WebStorm.

Other than that I just did some more reading in the Career Prep track. I'm trying to get ahead of the curve on that aspect. I'm debating if I should follow up with the business cards I received this weekend. As part of my career search requirements I have to reach out to 8 people per week. I could include these connections in that first week. Although, I think prompt follow up is better so I'll probably schedule some e-mails to go out first thing in the morning.

I also passed 80% done in the program tonight.
