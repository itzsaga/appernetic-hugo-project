Today didn't see much coding. Mostly because the Intro to Object Oriented Ruby is a 1:10.00 video by of Avi teaching the basics of OO Ruby. Which was good. I found that him talking through concepts made them more clear as I worked on just a couple labs afterwards. It also meant that I took some notes on things that I thought were most important.

Notes which of course I'll share:

> `self` is the implicit receiver of all non-explicit method calls.

also

> local variable is variable  
> instance variable is @variable  
> class variable is @@variable

and

> attr_reader macro creates getter method  
> attr_writer macro creates setter method  
> attr_accessor macro creats both setter and getter method

Avi also talked about how he personally only used the `attr_accessor` macro when he's building stuff. Then after everything is working he takes away abilities depending on what the methods actually are doing. The `attr_accessor` macro is the most flexible so it makes sense to use that by default.
