title: Strong Params Can Change
---

Not much going on but completing a couple larger labs tonight. One significant things that halted me for a while was an issue in my strong params. I had:

```ruby
def song_params
  params.permit(:title, :released, :release_year, :artist_name, :genre)
end
```

Which looks really nice but doesn't take into account that I'm using `form_for` and thus my submitted data is actually a nested hash. A quick change to:

```ruby
def song_params
  params.require(:song).permit(:title, :released, :release_year, :artist_name, :genre)
end
```

Had me moving along again. That's all I have energy to type tonight  since my 4 month old had me up at 6am this morning.
