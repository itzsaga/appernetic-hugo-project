I don't know what it is tonight but I just can't get into the groove. I'm steady distracted and not focused. And no it's not because of the date, you know you were thinking it. Ugh. At least it's on a "short" day and I did attend a meetup tonight so I did something beneficial to my coding journey that took a few hours of my evening. I am a few pages into one of my notebooks though so I can say that's good. Maybe I'll lookup the [CORS][1] spec instead of doing anymore Rails learning tonight. It's a topic I heard about at the beginning of the month but still haven't read up on at all (I had to look up that link just now).
