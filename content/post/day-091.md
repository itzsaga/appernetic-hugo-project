title: I Mustache You A Question
---

Yes I just made that joke. However, I'm in the middle of a [Handlebars.js][1] lab so I think it's fitting.

>Handlebars uses the curly brace as a delimiter because if you turn it
sideways it looks like a mustache, and Handlebars.js is an extension of
the Mustache template language.

Today was a lot of HTML, CSS, and Templating so no new notes on anything. I find that HTML & CSS stick pretty well and until I'm actually using a templating language in a project I won't take notes just yet. The docs are typically good enough for quick searches through. Like the lab where I had to use [Basscss][2] it was easy enough to just use "Find" on the website to get my code to do what I needed.

Spent most of the afternoon at my neighbors house for their daughter's birthday. She's turning 3 just like my little one will in less than a month.
